# Games
This is a repository for some games I will build on python. 
Mastermind is the first one that I have finished, it is a wordle style guessing game where the user has to get a code from a given list of alphabets. The user can exit the game prematurely,get hints or the answer directly. I have used gemini,microsoft copilot and a few you tube vids in order to learn the required concepts,to correct some mistakes made and to make the code more efficient.
